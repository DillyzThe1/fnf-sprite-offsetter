Hey! You're probably wondering how to use this program.
Well, adding a custom character is pretty easy.
First, go to "assets\custom-characters".
Next, paste the png and xml files.
Now you want to make a txt file using the same name as the png and xml.
If you need to see what i mean, look at "assets\custom-characters\Pico_FNF_assetss.txt"

Now that you have a txt with said file name, go into both that file and the xml. (i recommend notepad++ for this)
On every line do the following:

Look in the xml for an animation name.
You should see something like "<SubTexture name="Pico Down Note0000" x="0" y="0" width="723" height="382">"
The name for this xml animaiton is called "Pico Down Note", which is grouped with everything under the same name.
Now, go into the txt we mentioned earlier after copying that.
Let's say we want to call this "singDOWN" like most down note animations are called.
You need to type the following on the next line down (if there are no lines, start at the top):
	animNAME:Xml Animation Name
Which in our case is:
	singDOWN:Pico Down Note

Now repeat that whole section for every animation and boot up the program.
Good luck!

(NOTE: animation offsets currently do not read or write, please write them down yourself.)
(BTW YOU NEED AN ANIMATION CALLED 'idle' OR THE GAME MIGHT CRASH!)
