# FNF Sprite Offsetter

This is the repo for my custom haxe program that can help you determine offsets for in-game sprites.<br/>

This is NOT a mod, but this is also NOT offical.<br/>
All assets and rights belong to [NinjaMuffin99](https://twitter.com/ninja_muffin99), who made FNF with the help of [PhantomArcade3K](https://twitter.com/phantomarcade3k), [Evilsk8r](https://twitter.com/evilsk8r), and [Kawaisprite](https://twitter.com/kawaisprite).<br/>
The source code was written by [me (DillyzThe1!)](https://github.com/DillyzThe1), however.<br/>

This was made by studying the source code of the original game, the kade engine, and various articales on haxe documentation.<br/>
Please play the original game here: https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/friday-night-funkin<br/>
Also, some credit to: https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine<br/>
And finally, self promotion to my discord: https://discord.gg/49NFTwcYgZ<br/>

IF you wish to distribute edits to this, PLEASE fork the project and open source it.<br/>

(NOTE: this program was also made for people modding FNF without asset replacements, because asset replacements are cringe.)<br/>

If you JUST wish to you use this, PLEASE go to the [releases tab.](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/fnf-sprite-offsetter/releases).<br/>

If you DO wish to add onto this, however, continue reading!<br/>

First, make sure you HAVE compiled FNF before.<br/>
You're gonna need all of that stuff.<br/>

You can get that tutorial here: [FNF "README.md" file](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin/blob/master/README.md#build-instructions)<br/>

If you have compiled the game up to this point on this computer atleast once, then follow these instructions:<br/>
1. Clone the repostory and obtain the source code, preferably in a way that allowed you to fork it. (Personally, i just hit "Code" and "Download ZIP" for the source)<br/>
2. Extract the zip and go to where you can see something like this:<br/>
